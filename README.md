# Day 1 – JavaScript Practice Tasks

This repository contains my first day JavaScript practice programs.
The goal of these tasks is to understand JavaScript basics, functions, operators, and user input/output.

## Topics Covered

* Variables (let, const)
* Operators (+, -, *, /)
* Arrow Functions
* Functions & Return Values
* Conditional Statements
* Basic Calculations using JavaScript

## Programs Included

### 1. Simple Calculator (Normal Function)

A basic calculator that performs:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

It takes two numbers as input and returns the result.
